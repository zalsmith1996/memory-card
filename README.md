## Memory Card 
Memory Card game created while working through [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/dashboard).

## About
The Memory Card game pulls a set number of random images from an API to display to the user alongside current and high scores. To play the game, users will select one card at a time, making sure they keep track of which cards have previously been selected. The goal is to select every available card once, without selecting a previously selected card. If the user selects a card that was previously chosen, the score resets and a new round begins. Users will also have the option to generate new images, and toggle game instructions to display.

### Notes
This is the second project within the React section of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/dashboard). The intent is to gain experience using newly introduced hooks, creating components, and importing from APIs.
